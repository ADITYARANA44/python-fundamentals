#Operators:-
#Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables.
#Types:

#1 Arithmetic operators
# a = 12
# b = 50

# print(a + b)                    #Addition
# print(a - b)                    #Subtraction
# print(a * b)                    #Multiplication
# print(a / b)                    #Division
# print(a // b)                   #Floor-division
# print(b % a)                    #Modulus
# print(a**b)                     #Exponentiation

#2 Assignment operators
#Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. 
#'=' is the assignment operator 

#3 Comnpund assignment operators
# a = 10

# a = a + 10
#print(a)
#but there is also another way to write this operation
# a += 10
# print (a)

# +=                                 #Add and assign
# -=                                 #Subract and assign
# *=                                 #Multiply and assign
# /=                                 #divide and assign
# //=                                #Floor division and assign 
# %=                                 #Modulus and assign 
# **=                                #Exponentation and assign

#4 Comparison operators
#Comparision operators are used to compare variables with each other.
#(also comparision operators will always give's answer in bool(True/false))

# a = 20
# b = 15

# print(a < b)                        #less than
# print(a > b)                        #Greater than
# print(a <= b)                       #Less than equal to
# print(a >= b)                       #Greater than equal to
# print(a == b)                       #Equal to
# print(a != b)                       #Not equal to

#5 Logical operators
#There are basically three types of logical operators.
#'and' , 'or' and 'not'
#eg:
# a = 10
# b = 20
# print(a < b and a != b)
# print(a > b or b > a)
# print(not a)
