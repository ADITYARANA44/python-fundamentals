#COMMENTS IN PYTHON:-
#Comments are something that are ignored by the python interpreter.
#We have to use '#' for writing a comment in python.
#eg:
#This is a single line comment.

#In python there are no multi-line comments available but we can acheive it by using 'Doc-string'.
#eg:
"""So this is 
a multi line comment.
with this we can comment multiple lines
in one go."""
